###Bidder

Bidder is a website that connects people looking for someone to perform an odd job with those offering their skills nearby. Bidders can post a job, offer payment, and jobbers can choose to accept and arrange a meeting. Bidder is not involved with the payments or transaction, only the meetup. Bidder is geared towards those looking for independent contracts to complete tasks large or small, for fair pay.
